This is a simple game created by me using pygame. It consists of 5 .py files and additional graphical and audio resources. Player's objective is to break all the bricks using arrow
keys to control the platform that bounces the ball. If the ball falls down the player looses one life and is given a second chance. The game finishes after compleating 5 levels.
Additionaly the player may choose a difficulty level before starting the game using the options menu.
